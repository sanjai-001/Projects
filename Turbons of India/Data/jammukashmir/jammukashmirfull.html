                A “Brokpa” tribal is identified by a colourful headgear called “Tepi” that has a silver base embellished with fresh and dried colourful berry flowers from the mountains and various colourful props.
            </p>
            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
              In the high altitudes of Ladakh, beyond the usual tourist spots like Pangong Lake, majestic hills or the monasteries, there survives a tribe believed to be one of the oldest tribes known as “Brokpa” or “Drokpa”. They had no medical facilities in the past, so each prop on the head gear has some medicinal purpose. The seven colored ribbon wards any ailment caused by the Sun or eclipse. The silver brooches ward off planetary influences, the peacock feather wards off paralysis,” says a teacher in Darchik.
