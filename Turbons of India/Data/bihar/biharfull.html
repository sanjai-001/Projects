                A campaign to promote use of the paag was begun in 2016 by Mithilalok, a Mithila cultural pressure group set up in that year. Called Paag Bachau Abhiyan (Save the Paag Campaign), Mithilalok was associated with a proposed symbolic wearing of the garment by some representatives in the Bihar Legislative Council in August 2016, and also with a move to have it recognised as an official head-dress of the state of Bihar.

              The Paag dates back to pre-historic times when it was made of plant leaves. It exists today in a modified form , Paags designed and developed by Mithilalok are of different shades, colours and shapes considering fitting and suitability.. The Paag is considered as a symbol of pride in Mithila. The colour of the Paag also carries a lot of significance. The red Paag is worn by the bridegroom and by those who are undergoing the sacred thread rituals. Paag of mustard colour is donned by those attending wedding ceremonies and the elders wear a white Paag.
