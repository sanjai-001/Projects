            <b class="title">Introduction</b>:
            <p>
              One of the lesser-known textile crafts from this region are the aal (Morinda citrifolia) dyed handloom fabrics used mainly as a sari by the tribal women and as a turban or a shoulder cloth by men.
            </p>
            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
              Weaving of aal-dyed textiles is known to the Bastar region since the 16th century, which was most probably brought from the village Kotpad in the district Koraput of the neighbouring state of Odisha. However, there are no records or reference of it in the form of a sample or text.Villages such as Tokapal, Nagarnar and Kondagaon in Bastar had weavers who were experts at dyeing and weaving of aal-dyed fabrics (Singh, Chishti and Sanyal, 1989). Earlier, each village used to grow their cotton crop for weaving. The natural base or unbleached cotton yarns are used for the body of the pata, a sari-like drape worn by the women of Muria and Maria (Plate 1). The woven cloth known as phatai is made manually on pit looms. The process of weaving traditional pata is known locally as phatai bunana.

            <b class="title">Design</b>:
            <p>
                 Each community expresses its identity through a sense of aesthetics that evolved from a specific aspect of their history including migration patterns.Their designs and crafts are inspired from the forms found in nature and their observations and interpretation of objects and hence have a na√Øve appeal
            </p>
            <b class="title">Significance</b>:
            <p>
              Inspired by legends and folklore, and rooted in their everyday life,  motifs and patterns found in their crafts carry deep significance
