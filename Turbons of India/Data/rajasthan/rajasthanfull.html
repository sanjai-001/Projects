            <p>
                Turbans worn in Rajasthan are referred to as the pagari. They vary in style, colour and size. They also indicate a wearer's social class, caste, region and the occasion it being worn for.

            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
                The Wodeyars, or the rulers of Mysore, used to wear the Mysuru Peta as their royal headgear during Durbars.
                During these Durbars, although the King has the choice of his attire, it was mandatory to the attendants to wear preferred attire, which was a long black coat with white trousers and a Mysuru Peta. Ordinarily a turban of a single colour is worn. However, turbans of one of more colours may be worn by the elite or during special occasions such as festivals or weddings

Its shape and size may also vary with the climatic conditions of the different regions. Turbans in the hot desert areas are large and loose. Farmers and shepherds, who need constant protection from the elements of nature, wear some of the biggest turbans. . A Safa is shorter and broader.
