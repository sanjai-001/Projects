              Thalappavu means turbans which were worn by men of authority.

            <p>
              Generally, Nair Forces (Nair Pada/Nair Pattalam) wore red turbans along with red Uttariyam (Red Shawl that tied around the waist) over their White Mundu with red borders. Muslim soldiers being seen as the same level of Nairs, also worn the same red colored attire, but not turbans, rather Turkish Red caps instead. Auxiliary forces that comprise of men from other castes wore different colored turbans to distinguish their castes and cadres, mostly Yellow, Blue, Green etc. One can see this turban today in Velakali, an artform which Nair forces performed upon victory in war before Lord Padmanabha and Ambalapuzha Krishna. The turban remained even after the introduction of modernly styled suitings as uniforms for army officials in the 19th century. With merging of Nair forces with Madras Regiment of Indian Army in the 1900s, this culture of red turbans came to an end.Travancore/Kochi Police used to wear turbans as part of its uniform untill the end of the 1940s. The traditional uniform is now seen during the Vellakali performance which was the victory dance of Nair Soldiers This was ended with Kerala Police adopted All India Police uniform pattern in the 1950s
