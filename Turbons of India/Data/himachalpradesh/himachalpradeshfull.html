              HIMACHAL PRADESH

            <b class="title">Introduction</b>:
            <p>
              Himachali cap (Bushehri topi, Pahari topi, Kinnauri topi) is a distinctive headdress associated with Himachal Pradesh's culture. It is a part of the traditional dress of many Pahari inhabitants.

            </p>
            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
              The Himachali cap was historically related to Kinnaur and reached other parts of Himachal Pradesh via princely state of Bushahr and Kullu. The weaving style and materials used for these caps differ from each other. The typical green colored Kinnauri / Bushahri cap is also worn in the adjoining areas of Garhwal Himalayas, specially in Dehradun (Jaunsar-Bawar), Uttarkashi and Tehri Garhwal. A similar, but different variety of red colored cap is worn in Uttarkashi and the neighboring areas of Garhwal (not to be confused with red colored Dhumal cap). These caps are more prevalent in the upper districts of Himachal and Garhwal. In Garhwal these caps are also known as Sikoli.

            </p>
            <b class="title">Design</b>:
            <p>
              Himachali caps are one of the popular arts and crafts of Himachal Pradesh. The Himachali cap is usually made of wool, and the shape is typically round or boat shape.
            </p>
            <b class="title">Significance</b>:
            <p>
              Cap is an ingrained part of daily wear over there, and it is common during local festivities, religious functions and marriage. Himachali caps are the representation of cultural identity. People in Himachal consider the cap as a pride, like a turban for Sikhs in Punjab.
