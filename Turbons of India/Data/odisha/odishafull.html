            <b class="title">State of Origin</b>:
            <p>
              Orissa
            </p>
            <b class="title">Introduction</b>:
            <p>
              This headgear is wore by Bonda Tribeswomen of Orissa . It is made up of beads , coins  and sea shells .
            </p>
            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
                The Bonda people are a tribal people who currently live in the hills of Odishaâ€™s Malkangiri district in India. Adibari and Budei, both in their mid-20s, have come to the Mela from Bonda Hills (Khairput) in Malkangiri with their traditional jewellery made from glass beads, coins and sea shells. The turuba is made of grass and the lobeda made of beads. Worn together the turuba secures the lobeda by preventing the beaded headband from slipping off the woman's head.
            </p>
            <b class="title">Design</b>:
            <p>
              Bonda women have their heads shaved and adorned with two types of headbands, called turuba and lobeda. Beads are integral to women of Bonda tribe of Odisha .Demonstrating the craft of making these fine jewellery pieces, the girls carefully put multi-coloured beads into strings of thin plastic threads to create beautiful pieces of chains. They wear these multi-strings glass bead chains as headgear and around their necks along with thick aluminium neck pieces.
            </p>
            <b class="title">Significance</b>:
            <p>
              Since Bonda women hunt and forage for food in the forest it is thought that these ornaments have a function of protecting them from injuries and attacks by wild animals.
