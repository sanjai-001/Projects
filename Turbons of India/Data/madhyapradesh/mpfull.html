            <p>
                Chanderi silk is undoubtedly a brand in the local garment industry. The ancient Sanskrit literature, including the 1200 B.C Rig Veda and the Mahabharata, provide interesting references to the famous Chanderi silk fabric.
                The Scindian royal family patronized Chanderi  in 1910 and during this period, we saw the appearance of the golden thread motif. However, the love for this fabric was greatly intensified in the Mughal era. The queens in the country were often seen flaunting Chanderi silk garments in courts and on special occasions.
                It was in the 1930s that Chanderi weavers got their hands on Japanese silk and started substituting it in cotton saree warps. They also managed to develop a special silk-by-silk variant since it earned them higher profits.

                This is a kind of turban made of bright colours . The famous Chanderi fabric is a hand-woven combination of silk and cotton. There has been a significant transformation in the motif designs of Chanderi over the years. Today, in addition to florals, peacocks and ancient coin patterns, Chanderi is also seen in modern geometric designs.
