            <b class="title">State of Origin</b>:
            <p>
              Karnataka
            </p>
            <b class="title">Introduction</b>:
            <p>
              The Mysuru peta (peta is a Kannada word which means turban in English) is the classical royal Indian attire worn by the erstwhile Kings of Mysuru, called the Wodeyars (1399 to 1947), of the Kingdom of Mysuru. Wodeyars wore a richly bejeweled turban made of silk and jari (gold threaded lace) to match with colorful dresses as part of the royal dress.
            </p>
            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
              Administrators under the King, such as the Dewans' (Prime Minister appointed by the King) and other senior officials who swayed considerable power in matters of state administration also wore the Mysuru peta.
After India became independent in 1947 and the princely state merged with the Indian union, the traditional Mysuru peta has been retained as a symbol of heritage and cultural antecedents and distinguished people are honoured by the award of a Mysore peta with a shawl in formal functions.

Kings wore the traditional Mysuru peta as headgear during the Durbar (court of Indian or princley state's kings) time or in a ceremonial procession during the Dassara celebrations and or during joint ceremonial parades with the visiting royal dignitaries from foreign countries.
It was expected that the men attending King's court wore the conventional attire called the durbar dress which comprised a black long coat with white trousers and a compulsory Mysuru peta (turban).

            <b class="title">Design</b>:
            <p>
              The attractive and colourful turban is a headdress made up of long scarfâ€“like single piece of cloth made of silk or cotton wound round the head cap and is often decorated with jari border (golden or silver laces) and beautiful metal pendants that adds to its glory and grandeur.

            <b class="title">Significance</b>:
            <p>
              The people of the Mysuru district and the Kodagu district feel proud to wear turbans called Mysuru peta. In Kodagu district, it is part of the traditional dress worn on special occasions such as weddings. Men wear a turban during religious ceremonies to portray respect and reverence towards the Supreme Being. Distinguished people are honoured by the award of a Mysuru peta in formal functions.
