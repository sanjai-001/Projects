            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
                “Pagdi are very actively used these days. The culture of pagadis in Hyderabad has been around for many years, as the Nizams and their courtiers including the Nawabs of Hyderabad used the pagadis as a symbol of royalty and honour.”“The uniform of students from Nizam College and Osmania University during the Nizam era was also incomplete without the typical Nizami cap and the Sherwani . Prior to Independence, the pagadis were worn largely by the so-called elite classes. However, after Hyderabad State merged into India, pagadis were adopted by the general masses. Today, the situation is such that marriages and functions in Old City seem to be incomplete without seeing men sporting pagadis, as it has become an integral part of the attire. “About 20 to 25 years ago, simple padagis were made. Now, those are outdated, and we have changed with the changing times and the designs have become more colourful and vibrant. And presently, this pagdi was old fashioned or out of fashioned wear. This pagdi making industry is literally dying nowadays.

            <b class="title">Design</b>:
            <p>
                The pagadis were made  with Organza fabric, besides silk and cotton. While the older generation prefers plain pagadis, the younger generation has turned these turbans into a fashion trend and are looking for newer, bold patterns. Many even want their pagadis decorated with ornaments.
            </p>
            <b class="title">Significance</b>:
            <p>
                Many people in Hyderabad believe wearing Pagdi or Turban is a symbol of prestige in olden days. And then pagdi became the fashion symbol and remained a groom’s attire on his wedding day.
