            <b class="title">Introduction</b>:
            <p>
              The Copel is a traditional flower crown worn in goa during the sao joao festival.

            </p>
            <b class="title">History</b>:
            <p>
              Some believe that the Kopel or flower crown originated from the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ but there’s actually a more joyful explanation. Another tradition associated with the festivities is that of the traditional visit by newlyweds to the bride’s home. The Kopel was actually placed on the groom’s head after the newlyweds entered the house, as a welcoming act.

              With the monsoons underway, flowers can be found blooming everywhere. These are taken, woven together in an intricate arrangement with leaves and worn throughout the day’s festivities.The variety of flowers used is pretty amazing. Hibiscus flowers, Roses, and all kinds of locally found flowers go into the design.

            <b class="title">Significance</b>:
            <p>
              The crown worn during Sao Joao is an ubiquitous part of the feast day attire. The copel (crown) worn by revellers denotes the crown of martyrdom of St John the Baptist. One specimen that adorns the crown is a creeper locally known as the sanjuachi vaal.

It is found growing in wells usually towards the end of summer after the first onset of seasonal showers. Back in the day we used to make crowns of any locally available flowers. The creeper was easy to twist and form into a crown. It has also small red flowers which further help to beautify the crown.
